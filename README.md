moduPascal
----------

A fun little command-line toy for displaying <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle>Pascal's triangle</a> calculated using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic>modular arithmetic</a>.
It supports filtering, that is, showing only one number, displaying the rest as a '-' character.

Hint: If you play around, you may find another famous triangle.
